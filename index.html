		<p>About me: Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my Name is Zach Dana. I am a junior year student currently working on a bachelorâ€™s degree in Network and Digital Technology at UC Santa Cruz. I am currently learning computer architecture, data structures, and the design build experience in my coursework. I am looking to collaborate on backend and ML software engineering projects, and for help finding research opportunities and industry experience. Ask me about my experience with VEX and VEX U Robotics! A fun fact about me is that I also play on UC Santa Cruz club rugby.</p>
